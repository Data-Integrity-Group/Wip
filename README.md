## preparing for resumption
* Try to produce a rendered version of GitHub content that can be distributed
  * this may be as simple as a CutAndPaste of the View version
    * verify that the GitHub Wikis still allow a choice of Markup
      * could this be used as part of a Render/Edit Rinse/Repeat loop?
* Can GitHub outputs be rendered as PDFs?

* experiment with:

### Wip
* start by:
  * exploring & introducing
    * ChatApi plugins
    * Notion and Slack
  * initially, focus on Notion
  * Can Slack be wrapped in Notion or vice-versa?
* A Public W(ork) i(n) p(rogress) that is being slowly bootstrapped.
  * the fact that this is a public repository suggests that there could also be a Public Slack channel for AdManCa
    * should AdManCa and DigCa be kept separated?
  * seemed to work, so further enhancements will be transferrd into this environment as the finish their Private test cycles
* -08-21: resuming this PR test
  * the `Create new branch and start PR' option appeared as ...-patch-1 after a first edit.
