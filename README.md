## 2024 quickLinks
- Privacy and Promises ( PaP ) are going tp be a major issue even for AdManOn

## 2023 quickLinks
- https://github.com/Data-Integrity-Group/Wip#civicatlas
  - these QLs can span repos in order to rationalize relative Priorities
    - this shouild work even with a mix of Private repos [ test this ]

### These quickLinks are for the convenience of the Author(s).  

As content matures, Author links will be replaced by convenient Reader links.  Also, standard Report sections will emerge and styling will strive to follow the WikiPedia and the TenChapters ( 0-9 ) quidelines.

These QLs can span repos in order to rationalize relative Priorities.  (a merged Priorities list likely has more value)

* https://github.com/Data-Integrity-Group/Wip#CivicAtlasQl
* https://github.com/Data-Integrity-Group/Wip#civicatlas.md
* https://github.com/Data-Integrity-Group/Wip#APIdevelopmentConsiderations

* when should more folders be added to this repo?
  * Text block creation and Permission Management are likely to be the determining forces.
    * this may be a duplicated item

* PR - with an attached file
  * try using MailFail as a learning/focus Project with CivicAtlas
    * invested Public data like Municipal Addresses should be capable of forming Aliases to LaLoAl strings
      * it may even be effective to encode these as short-URLs that can then be incorporated into QrCodes

* Gist or Profile is a fundamental initial choice
  * https://gist.github.com/HwWobbe

* Dig should be a subset of AdManCa  (Division) of CSI (for now)
  * consider the implications of the external "divisions" distinctions made by Empire
    * how would these be integrated into our (merged) Notice To Reader statements?
      * what are the Tax implications?
        * a 50%+ position should still allow for consolidated statements
   * how is this impactefd by the Amalgamation
     * ... 

* reverse the drift away from the API focus.
  * this could lead to a refactoring/restructuring

* create a private repo to test access permissions further

<hr>

## CivicAtlasQl
* this topic is growing to a size that warrants a new file
  * where?
* Civic Atlas may provide information that can be used to assess internal Referential Integrity
  * this could lead to the development of a Trust for specific, large transactions
    * consider the use of floor limits (prior to debit cards) in Merchant Credit Card processing
      * this may fit well into a new AppContext combining YotiD and CivicAtlasD
        * ...rveiew DataGraph > KnowledgeGraph > InformationGraph
  * consider re-purposing this repo for use with CivicAtlas
    * a joint use for CivivAtlas and GeoSpatial TW could be beneficial
      * separate repos will eventually be needed.
        * TW documentation contributions are a logical first step.
    * CivicAtlas (CA & Ca) provides extensive APIs
      * assess this capability in joint contexts (perhaps with Cities)
    * this may lead to a free-minum model
    * initially this could include DPL & JCL and Jeremy
      * check with CivicAtlass about their uses of GIT
   * Ls may see this as a step towrds MailFail - thiat might advance c-suite goals - in AdManCa
     * this may, at least, result in prototypes of Management / Board  interactions
  * Consider this as a DueDiligence exercise shared by Buyer & Seller.

* try to integrate the RstT VeryTrue concepts
  * let Rst know when this is done


## enhancement considerations
...

* Produce a rendered version of GitHub content that can be distributed
  * review the particular advantages of ...md files
    * consider the capabilities of various .md dialects
      * tw compatibility would be an advantage
        * Style compromizes for "simplest", common may be posible

* Try to produce a rendered version of GitHub content that can be distributed
  * this may be as simple as a CutAndPaste of the View version
    * verify that the GitHub Wikis still allow a choice of Markup
      * could this be used as part of a Render/Edit Rinse/Repeat loop?

* Can GitHub outputs be
  * rendered as PDFs?
  * saved as Word docs that can be processed further by others?
    * AI styling should reduce the need for realAssistants
      * perhaps there is a need for a higher priority DevTools task?
        * such a re-structuring may also help with shared MicroContent
       
* experiment with:
  * the 'Code' sidebar control
  * also Edit , Preview , ...
* add the other headersH sections that are now standard
* [gitGocs/Start](https://docs.github.com/en/search-github/github-code-search/understanding-github-code-search-syntax)
* extend PR capabilities
  * ...
* https://giscus.app/

* how should folders be added to a repo?
  * ...


# APIdevelopmentConsiderations
* ...

## A tentative start at creating an API infrastructure

* this will likely have to be a rest-ful API
* start crafting the API collaboration infrastructure
  * caution collaborators that this infrastructue will always be ported on-shore and cannot have access to production DefData
    * 3rd party testing will be mandatory
* multiple, small PlusCode developments should be encouraged.

* link to the new ... page

### Wip
#### start by:

* exploring & introducing
  * ChatApi plugins
  * Notion and Slack
* initially, focus on Notion
* Can Slack be wrapped in Notion or vice-versa?

* A Public W(ork) i(n) p(rogress) that is being slowly bootstrapped.
  * the fact that this is a public repository suggests that there could also be a Public Slack channel for AdManCa
    * should AdManCa and DigCa be kept separated?
  * seemed to work, so further enhancements will be transferrd into this environment as the finish their Private test cycles

* -08-21: resuming this PR test
  * the `Create new branch and start PR' option appeared as ...-patch-1 after a first edit.

* ㋀㋁㋂㋃㋄㋅㋆㋇㋈㋉㋊㋋ extend with the .ye values
