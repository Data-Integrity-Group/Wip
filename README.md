## enhancement considerations
...

* Try to produce a rendered version of GitHub content that can be distributed
  * review the particular advantages of ...md files
    * consider the capabilities of various .md dialects
      * tw compatibility would be an advantage
        * Style compromizes for "simplest", common may be posible

  * this may be as simple as a CutAndPaste of the View version
    * verify that the GitHub Wikis still allow a choice of Markup
      * could this be used as part of a Render/Edit Rinse/Repeat loop?

* Can GitHub outputs be
  * rendered as PDFs?
  * saved as Word docs that can be processed further by others?
    * AI styling should reduce the need for realAssistants
      * perhaps there is a need for a higher priority DevTools task?
        * such a re-structuring may also help with shared MicroContent
       
* experiment with:
  * the 'Code' sidebar control
  * also Edit , Preview , ...
* add the other headersH sections that are now standard
* [gitGocs/Start](https://docs.github.com/en/search-github/github-code-search/understanding-github-code-search-syntax)
* craft and refine a PR

## A tentative start an creating an API infrastructure

* this will likely have to be a rest-ful API
* start crafting the API collaboration infrastructure
  * caution collaborators that this infrastructue will always be ported on-shore and cannot have access to production DefData
    * 3rd party testing will be mandatory
* multiple, small PlusCode developments should be encouraged.

* link to the new ... page

### Wip
* start by:
  * exploring & introducing
    * ChatApi plugins
    * Notion and Slack
  * initially, focus on Notion
  * Can Slack be wrapped in Notion or vice-versa?
* A Public W(ork) i(n) p(rogress) that is being slowly bootstrapped.
  * the fact that this is a public repository suggests that there could also be a Public Slack channel for AdManCa
    * should AdManCa and DigCa be kept separated?
  * seemed to work, so further enhancements will be transferrd into this environment as the finish their Private test cycles
* -08-21: resuming this PR test
  * the `Create new branch and start PR' option appeared as ...-patch-1 after a first edit.
